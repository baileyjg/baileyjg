### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

With a strong interest in technology, I've dedicated the past 4 years to computer engineering, garning tons of knowledge to support a strong foundation in various programming languages and system architecture.

I intend to graduate with my Bacehlor's in Computer Engineering in December of this year. Currently, I am interning with Arvest Bank learning the ropes of the real world from industry professionals.
